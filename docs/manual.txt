APN-Converter (for Alpine ida-X100)
	- short reference -
===================================

0. introduction
---------------

The APN-converter converts background image files from most common graphic formats
into the 'APN'-file format used by the Alpine ida-X100 (and maybe other devices, too).
Also, the tool allows to convert 'APN'-files to the Windows Bitmap format thus for
example allowing to edit the background images provided by Alpine.

1. limitations
--------------

The APN-format restricts the resolution of an image to exactly 320x240 pixels with
a colour depth of 16 Bit per Pixel. Also, the maximum allowed filename length is
6 characters, only CAPITAL letters or numbers allowed.

2. usage
--------

The APN-Converter tool provides a command line interface. To open the command line:
	click the 'Start' button
	click 'Run...'
	enter 'cmd'		(without '')
The appearing blackish window is where you can enter commands to use the tool. To
use the tool, change to the directory where you copied the 'ApnConverter.exe' file
using 'cd'

Example: if you installed the tool to c:\tmp, then you need to enter:

	cd c:\tmp
	
followed by pressing the [RETURN] key.


2.0 prerequisites / installation
---------------------------------
The APN-Converter tool requires a MS .Net-Framework installation (2.0 or later).
To install the APN-Converter to your machine, simply copy the .exe-file provided
(ApnConverter.exe) to any directory (e.g. C:\tmp).


2.1 convert TO APN FROM other graphic format
--------------------------------------------

Since the APN-Format only allows a resolution of 320x240, make sure the file you
are going to convert has exactly this resolution. If the file does not have the
proper resolution, use a graphic manipulation tool of your choice to make it so.

For simplicity, copy the file you are going to convert into the installation
directory (e.g. c:\tmp).

Assuming you changed to the installation directory, enter the following at the
command line:

	ApnConverter tpApn SOURCE TARGET TARGET.APN

replacing:

	SOURCE	by the image's filename you wish to convert
	TARGET	by an arbitrary name of exactly 6 (!) characters or numbers
	TARGET.APN	by the same name + .APN

Example:
	
Assuming the file you copied is named 'mySourceFile.bmp', and the new file shall
be named BACK00.APN, type into the command line:

	apnconverter toapn mySourceFile.bmp BACK00 BACK00.APN
	

As a result, a file named 'BACK00.APN' will be created. Copy this file to your 
USB mass storage device (into the root directory!).


2.2 convert FROM APN TO Windows Bitmap
--------------------------------------

For simplicity, copy the file you are going to convert into the installation
directory (e.g. c:\tmp).


Assuming you changed to the installation directory, enter the following at the
command line:

	ApnConverter toBmp SOURCE DESTINATION
	
replacing:

	SOURCE			by the APN-file's filename
	DESTINATION		by the output file's name

	
Example:

Assuming the file you copied is named 'MYAPN0.APN', and the output file shall be
named 'MyConvertedBitmap.bmp', enter:

	apnconverter tobmp MYAPN0.APN MyConvertedBitmap.bmp
	
Note: you are not required to use '.bmp' as an ending for the output file name, but
since the file will always be a Windows Bitmap, it is a good idea to to so.
